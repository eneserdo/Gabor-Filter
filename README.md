# Gabor-Filter

Gabor Filter is well-known filter in image processing which is used for texture analysis, edge detection, optical recognition systems so on so forth. It is considered as a filter that  is very similar to humans visual system.

I tried to show effects of parameters on filter. These parameters are

λ — Wavelength of the sinusoidal component.
Ө — The orientation of the normal to the parallel stripes of Gabor function.
Ψ — The phase offset of the sinusoidal function.
σ — The sigma/standard deviation of the Gaussian envelope
ɣ — The spatial aspect ratio and specifies the ellipticity of the support of Gabor function.

Firstly, I demonstrated filter and its fourier transform. It can be understood that gsbor filter is bandpass filter.

Then, I used example image which was applied bank of gabor filter with different orientatons (theta values).
